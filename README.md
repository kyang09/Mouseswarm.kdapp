This app isn't finished yet.
What it does is create random orbiting icon blocks when you press "SWARM !!!"
The "Destroy Some" button is quite self-explanatory: it destroys some. (destroys between 1 to 11 blocks each time)
The "Reset" button is also self-explanatory: it resets the blocks incase you cannot get rid of blocks.

Something I should fix: the "Destroy Some" button doesn't work as well when you are only down to 1 to 3 blocks, as chances of  getting 1,2,3 from all numbers between 1 to 11 RANDOMLY (thought we all know it's not actualy random) is small.

Also note that, on my computer, my web browser could only handle about 1700 blocks. During the test, the gray background turned white, maybe because it needs all the resources it can get, so it kind of disregarded the background color. Any explanations are welcomed!

Have a nice day
